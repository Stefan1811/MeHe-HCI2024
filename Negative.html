				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p> 
                    Overworked Cristian Cristescu, a 34-year-old professional navigating the relentless demands of the corporate world. 
                    Cristian's days are a whirlwind of meetings, deadlines, and projects, leaving him with little time to catch his breath. 
                    Despite recognizing the importance of mental health, Cristian remains skeptical about relying on digital tools to manage his well-being. 
                    He firmly believes in the power of face-to-face interactions with a psychologist over using an app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, Cristian thinks that he doesn't have time to explore new solutions amidst his busy schedule.
                    He is hesitant to invest time and energy into something he's unsure about.
                    He heard about going to therapy, but he is not sure if it will help him, so using an app is out of the question.

                </p>
          
				<p>
					Cristian's reluctance towards technology runs deep. 
                    He finds digital platforms overwhelming and worries about his privacy online. 
                    He prefers the comfort and familiarity of talking to a real person rather than engaging with an app, and he's hesitant to invest time and energy into something he's unsure about.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Cristian's main goal is to discover methods that can help him navigate his demanding work schedule while maintaining his mental well-being. 
                    However, he faces frustrations and pain points, including skepticism about digital tools, concerns about privacy, and the challenge of finding time to explore new solutions amidst his busy schedule.
				</p>
                <p>
                    Developers face the challenge of bridging the gap between Cristian's skepticism and the potential benefits of the app. 
                    Offering alternative options, like access to in-person therapy resources or personalized interventions, may help address Cristian's concerns and make the app more appealing to users like him.
