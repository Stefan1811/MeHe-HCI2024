				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Vlad is a 22-year-old student in his last year at FII (Faculty of Computer Science) in Ia»ôi, Romania.
					 He's feeling really stressed because of all the work he has to do this year. 
					 He's got lots of classes, his professors expect a lot from him, and he has to finish his big project before a certain deadline. 
					 Vlad feels like it's too much sometimes, and he's worried he might not be able to handle it all.
                </p>
				<p>
					Vlad spends a lot of time in the library or computer labs, working hard on his research papers and thesis drafts. 
					But sometimes, he finds it hard to figure out what he should do first. He ends up spending too much time on one thing or putting things off because he's worried.
					 This makes it tough for him to keep up with his part-time job at a cafe nearby. 
					He's been working late and sometimes even missing shifts because of all the school stuff he has to do.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vlad hasn't been hanging out with friends or doing his hobbies much lately. 
					He's feeling more and more alone and like he's losing touch with his friends. 
					Sometimes, he has to cancel plans at the last minute because he's stressed about his thesis. 
					This makes him feel bad, and his friends are disappointed too.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vlad knows a lot about different types of technology because of his studies. He's used apps for socializing and for school work, but he's never tried one that focuses on mental health. 
					Since he's in his final year studying Computer Science, Vlad has learned a lot about how apps are made and what makes them good or bad. 
					He doesn't like apps that are confusing or don't make it easy for people to use them. 
					He prefers apps that are simple and help him get things done without any hassle.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vlad found out about our app from a friend who said it might help him feel less stressed and more in control of his life.
					His primary goal is to find a way that helps him feeling much better about his life and his future. 
					He wants to be able to manage his time better and get things done without feeling so overwhelmed.
					Also, some impediments about the app that Vlad can encounter are: the lack of motivation to use the app, 
					the lack of time to use the app, the lack of understanding of the app, the lack of trust in the app.
